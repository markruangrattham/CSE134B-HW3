    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <article>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <about-me>
            
                Hello, I'm Mark Ruangrattham a 5th-year student at UCSD majoring in Computer Science
                and minoring in Economics. I'm an upcoming software engineer trying to get into big tech
                companies. I specialize in backend development but can also work on front-end development.
             
                I'm currently a web designer for one of UCSD Health's extension programs! I love the concept
                of software engineering because it's like building a puzzle you know the different pieces,
                but you have to use problem-solving skills to put it all together. Sometimes things don't go
                as planned, but that's what makes it fun and challenging.
              
                I'm eager to apply my technical expertise, problem-solving mindset, and creativity in the
                fast-moving world of technology â€” contributing to meaningful projects, tackling real-world
                challenges, and continuing to learn along the way.
